## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

To get TINIG up and running, you'll need to configure a few key environment variables for our integrated Google services and Firebase Authentication.

### Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file will store your sensitive API keys and configuration details. Add the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY='YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY'
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN='YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN'
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID='YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID'
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET='YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET'
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID='YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID'
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID='YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID'
REACT_APP_Maps_API_KEY='YOUR_Maps_API_KEY'
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API_KEY='YOUR_GOOGLE_TEXT_TO_SPEECH_API_KEY'
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_SPEECH_TO_TEXT_API_KEY='YOUR_GOOGLE_SPEECH_TO_TEXT_API_KEY'
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY='YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'
```

**Replace** the placeholder values (e.g., 'YOUR\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY') with your actual credentials. You can obtain these from your Google Cloud Platform and Firebase project settings.

### Google Cloud Platform Setup

1.  **Enable APIs:** Ensure the following APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud Project:
      * Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Geocoding API, Places API)
      * Cloud Text-to-Speech API
      * Cloud Speech-to-Text API
      * Gemini API (if using Google's Gemini models directly)
2.  **Service Accounts:** For production deployments, it's recommended to use service accounts with appropriate permissions for accessing Google Cloud Storage, Google Docs, and Google Drive.
3.  **Billing:** Google Cloud services require a billing account. Ensure your billing is set up and active.

### Firebase Setup

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** If you haven't already, create a new project in the Firebase console.
2.  **Register Your App:** Register your web app within your Firebase project to get your Firebase configuration details (API Key, Auth Domain, etc.).
3.  **Enable Authentication Methods:** In Firebase Authentication, enable the authentication methods you plan to use (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In).
